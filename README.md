# Medical Assistant Tool
 
## Description
This project is part of the Google Girls Hackathon. Developed by Pankhuri Garg, this Medical Assistant Tool utilizes machine learning to assist in medical diagnostics, and it is designed to be run on Google Colab.
 
## Installation
To run this project, you do not need to install any software on your local machine. Instead, you will use Google Colab, a free cloud service that supports Jupyter notebooks.

#### Alternatively
1. Visit [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Sign in with your Google account if not already signed in.
3. Click on `File` > `Open notebook`.
4. Select the `GitHub` tab in the dialogue box that appears.
5. Enter the URL of this GitHub repository and search.
6. Open the `medical_assistant.ipynb` notebook.
 
### Libraries
The necessary libraries are included in the Colab environment.
 
## Usage
Once the notebook is open:
1. You can run the entire notebook by selecting `Runtime` > `Run all` from the top menu.
2. Alternatively, you can run each cell individually by clicking the play button on the left side of each cell.
